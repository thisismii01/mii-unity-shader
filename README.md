# 🎨 mii-unity-shader

This repository is a personal collection of Unity shaders that I use, experiment with, or want to keep for future projects. It includes:

- ✍️ Shaders I've written or heavily modified
- 🌐 Shaders from third-party sources with open or public domain licenses
- 🎮 Small demo scenes and materials for each shader

---

## 🧾 Repository Purpose

- Store and organize reusable shaders in one place
- Quickly test shaders using included demo scenes
- Reuse shaders across multiple Unity projects

---

## 📁 Structure

Each shader or shader pack has its own folder and typically includes:
<pre> ShaderName/
├── Shaders/
├── Materials/
├── Scenes/
└── README.md (optional)
</pre>

## ✅ License & Third-Party Sources

Some shaders in this repository are adapted from or based on other open-source work. I only include shaders that meet one of the following conditions:

- Licensed under permissive licenses (MIT, BSD, Unlicense, etc.)  
- Declared as public domain  
- My own original or significantly modified work

## 🔐 Personal Use

This repository is intended for personal use, learning, and experimentation.  
You're welcome to explore the shaders, but please verify licenses yourself before using any third-party shaders in commercial projects.
